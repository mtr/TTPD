Basic Usage Guide for the TUC Transfer Protocol Daemon
=======================================================

After you have installed the programs (as described in the file
'INSTALL'), you may start to use the program.

The easiest way to start and stop the TTPD is by using the program
'ttpdctl'.

The most important flags to pay attention to are:

  -aADDRESS, --ip-address=ADDRESS
                        the ADDRESS of the interface on which to listen for
                        connections from clients; if ADDRESS is 0 (the default)
                        the server will listen on all available network
                        interfaces
  -pPORT, --port=PORT   listen for connections from clients on PORT; the
                        default is 2004
  -AADDRESS, --remote-ip-address=ADDRESS
                        the ADDRESS of the interface on which to send outgoing
                        communication; default is 'localhost'
  -PPORT, --remote-port=PORT
                        the remote PORT; the default is 2005
  -LLEVEL, --log-level=LEVEL
                        the filter LEVEL used when logging; possible values are
                        'debug' < 'info' < 'warning' < 'error' < 'critical';
                        the default is info
  -sCOMMAND, --path-to-tuc=COMMAND
                        run COMMAND as TUC subprocess; the default is
                        ./busestuc.sav
  -eEXECUTABLE, --executable=EXECUTABLE
                        location of the ttpd EXECUTABLE; the default is ttpd


A typical Web-installation would be started like:

  ttpdctl --path-to-tuc=$HOME/buster/busestuc start

possibly with the additional flag '--log-level=debug' to get detailed
debug information in the log.  If not specified with the
'--executable' flag, the daemon executable that will be started is the
first ttpd found in the current user's PATH environment variable.

If you would like to communicate with eSolutions, the following flags
must be used:

  --port=8081 --remote-ip-address=easprod.esolutions.no --remote-port=8000


To stop the daemon, type:

  ttpdctl stop

If you have changed the location of the log file, which is used for
retrieveing the PID of the currently running process, add the flag
'--old-log-file=<file>', where <file> denotes the new location.

The actions 'restart' and 'store_alerts' may be used in the same way
as 'stop'.
