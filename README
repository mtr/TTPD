This software is Copyright (C) 2004 by Martin Thorsen Ranang.

This package contains the implementation of TTPD and TAD.  The package
is written in Python (and was tested with Python 2.3.4 [on Linux] and
Python 2.3.3 [on SunOS]) and requires the Python installation to
support threads.
  
See the file INSTALL for information on how to build and install the
programs and the Python modules they use.
