In the following <version> is a generic identifier of the version you
are installing; your actual package version may be something like
'0.9.0'.

To install this package (and its scripts), the following should do:

1. Unpack the source distribution.  

       tar xvzf TTPD-<version>.tar.gz

2. Change to the directory that was created by the above command.

       cd TTPD-<version>/

3. Build and install the package.  If you want to install it locally
   (in your $HOME directories), the following comamnd should do:

       python setup.py install --optimize 2 --home=$HOME

   If you would like to install it system-wide, just skip the --home
   argument.

4. After you have installed the packages, you should add the path to
   where the Python modules from this package have been installed to
   the PYTHONPATH environment variable.  If you installed the package
   in your $HOME, that means adding something like this to your
   $HOME/.bash_profile (if you are using the BASH shell):
   
       export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/lib/python

That should be all that's needed to install this package.  After this,
the commands 'ttpd' and 'ttpc' should be available in the
'<your-install-path>/bin/' directory.
