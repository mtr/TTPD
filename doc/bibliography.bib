  ABSTRACT =	 {This work investigates the use of formal logic as a
                  practical tool for describing the syntax and
                  semantics of a subset of English, and building a
                  computer program to answer data base queries
                  expressed in that subset. To achieve an intimate
                  connection between logical descriptions and computer
                  programs, all the descriptions given are in the
                  definite clause subset of the predicate calculus,
                  which is the basis of the programming language
                  Prolog. The logical descriptions run directly as
                  efficient Prolog programs. Three aspects of the use
                  of logic in natural language analysis are covered:
                  formal representation of syntactic rules by means of
                  a grammar formalism based on logic, extraposition
                  grammars; formal semantics for the chosen English
                  subset, appropriate for data base queries; informal
                  semantic and pragmatic rules to translate analyzed
                  sentences into their formal semantics. On these
                  three aspects, the work improves and extends earlier
                  work by Colmerauer and others, where the use of
                  computational logic in language analysis was first
                  introduced.}

                  language-specific structures that are interconnected

                  discuss the possibilities to create mappings from
                  each wordnet to the central ILI and how the ILI
                  itself can be adapted to provide more overlap across
                  the wordnets. We will argue that the ILI can be
                  condensed to a more universal index of meaning,
                  while the wordnets can still encode any fine-grained
                  lexicalizations for each language.  },

                  for the encoding of a large amount of semantic
                  information, ranging from ontological typing, to
                  argument structure and terminology. SIMPLE thus
                  provides a general framework for resource

                  lexical semantics are coupled with the needs of

                  Question Answering (QA) system, it must be
                  understood at several different levels. First, the
                  complexity of the question needs to be identified
                  based on a combination of syntactic, semantic and
                  pragmatic knowledge. Second, since questions are
                  rarely asked in isolation, the question context
                  needs to be determined for better understanding its
                  request. Third, it is difficult to separate the
                  question intentions from the question formulation,
                  therefore plausible implications need to be coerced
                  from each question. Fourth, mechanisms that either
                  accept or reject the implied intentions are
                  needed. All these different processes impact on the
                  question understanding and implicitly on the

                  sought and then cooperate in locating and assembling
                  the answer. The system, which we call HITIQA11, has

                  unformatted data, and is additionally equipped with
                  limited capabilities to search and navigate this
                  set. The user asks questions in English, for example
                  {\^a}??What are the effects of pollution on
                  commercial fishing on the Black Sea?{\^a}??
                  Mediating between the data and the user is a

                  some sense of what the user is asking and what can
                  be retrieved from the database, and then reconcile
                  these through a dialogue. The purpose of the

                  between the human and the machine possible and as

                  with the question-answering tasks of TREC-9 and
                  TREC-2001. Our approach employed techniques from IR,
                  pattern matching and metakeyword detection with
                  little linguistic analysis and no natural language
                  understanding. It involved the following four steps:
                  1) retrieval of top-ranked subdocuments using
                  content keywords of a question as query; 2)
                  weighting of sentences from retrieved subdocuments
                  based on heuristic rules and matching with question
                  keywords; 3) refined weighting and ranking of
                  sentences using agreement with expected answer type
                  suggested by question analysis; and 4) extraction of
                  answer strings from top-ranked sentences based on
                  expected answer type and sentence word pattern
                  rules. The blind experiments in TREC showed that the
                  approach returned reasonably good results, excluding
                  those questions with NIL answer. It works because
                  the questions are mainly factoid, definitional
                  types. Analysis shows that our system improves with
                  more subdocuments retrieved, and if answer
                  candidates from two different retrieval lists are
                  combined by confirmation. It can identify sentences
                  containing answers quite well, but it often fails
                  when answers need to be extracted correctly within a
                  50-byte output. These experiments may serve as
                  examples of how far one can attain in open domain
                  question-answering without making use of external
                  resources (e.g. the web) to find answers, and

                  extraction (IE) in question answering (QA)
                  systems. Most QA systems are focused on
                  sentence-level answer generation. Such systems are
                  based on information retrieval (IR) techniques such
                  as passage retrieval in conjunction with shallow IE
                  techniques such as named entity
                  tagging. Sentence-level answers may be sufficient in
                  many applications focused on reducing information
                  overload: instead of a list of URLs provided by
                  search engines which need further perusal by the
                  user, sentences containing potential answers are
                  extracted and presented to the user. However, if the
                  goal is precise answers consisting of a phrase, or
                  even a single word or number, new techniques for QA
                  must be developed. Specifically, there is a need to
                  use more advanced IE and natural language processing
                  (NLP) in the answer generation process. This chapter
                  presents a system whereby multiple levels of IE are
                  utilized in a QA system that attempts to generate
                  the most precise answer possible, backing off to
                  coarser levels where necessary. In particular,
                  generic grammatical relationships are exploited in
                  the absence of information about specific
                  relationships between entities. An IE engine,
                  InfoXtract, is first described to illustrate the
                  types of IE and NLP output that is needed. Results
                  are presented for QA based on named entity tagging,
                  relationships between entities, and semantic
                  parsing, including more recent work that handles
                  caseless input. This work has implications for
                  broader coverage QA systems since domain-independent
                  IE results can be exploited and noisy input can be
                  ``normalized'' by restoration techniques.},

                  questions or aggregate relevant information in the
                  attempt. Currently, analysts derive most of the
                  information they need from a large corpora of
                  documents. The preferred means of doing so, for the
                  most part, is a threestep process of collect,
                  filter, and then process manually or
                  semi-automatically. The predominant paradigm
                  employed usually involves the Web, an information
                  retrieval (IR) engine such as Google, and intense
                  reading. Their real need, however, is to obtain

                  statistical and machine learning methods for
                  question answering. These techniques require
                  training data, usually in the form of
                  question/answer sets. In this chapter, we describe a
                  reverse-engineering procedure that can be used to
                  generate question/answer sets automatically from
                  ordinary text corpora. Our technique identifies
                  sentences that are good candidates for
                  question/answer extraction, extracts the portions of
                  the sentence corresponding to the question and the
                  answer, and then transforms the information into an
                  actual question and answer. Using this procedure, a
                  collection of questions and answers can be
                  automatically generated from any text corpus. One
                  key benefit of this automatic procedure is that
                  question/answer sets can be easily generated from
                  domain-specific corpora, creating training data
                  which could be used to build a Q/A system tailored
                  for a specific domain.",

                  three main elements of inferential
                  intention-recognition: meaning of utterances,
                  contextual and background assumptions, and
                  communicative principles, the latter has generated
                  most debate. Cooperation and relevance have emerged
                  as a possible basis for a communicative principle
                  that regulates verbal communication. According to
                  Grice and neo-Gricean researchers, inferential
                  intention-recognition is governed by a cooperative
                  principle and maxims, which speakers are expected to
                  observe. the supporters of the relevance theory
                  argued that cooperation is not essential to
                  communication, and suggested a reduction of Grice's
                  maxims to a single principle of relevance. According
                  to their view, a rational speaker will choose an
                  utterance that will provide the hearer with a
                  maximum number of contextual implications in a
                  minimum processing effort.",

                  produced by different clustering techniques. By
                  examining and combining two different clusterings of
                  a document collection, the aggregation aims at
                  revealing a better structure of the data rather than
                  imposing one that is imposed or constrained by the
                  clustering method itself. When clusters of documents
                  are formed, a process called topic extraction picks
                  terms from the feature space (i.e. the vocabulary of
                  the whole collection) to describe the topic of each
                  cluster. It is proposed at this stage to re-compute
                  terms weights according to the revealed cluster
                  structure. The work further investigates the
                  adaptive setup of the parameters required for the
                  clustering and aggregation techniques. Finally, a
                  topic accuracy measure is developed and used along
                  with the F-measure to evaluate and compare the
                  extracted topics and the clustering quality
                  (respectively) before and after the
                  aggregation. Experimental evaluation shows that the
                  aggregation can successfully improve the clustering
                  quality and the topic accuracy over individual
                  clustering techniques.",
